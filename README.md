## ü§î Reflection

### AI in Development
AI tools were instrumental in several aspects of this project. The AI service leverages natural language processing to generate context-aware questions based on product categories. For instance, it can ask specific questions about food ingredients for food products or manufacturing processes for electronics. The scoring algorithm uses weighted factors to evaluate transparency across multiple dimensions, providing a comprehensive assessment.

### Design Principles
1. **Modularity**: The application follows a clear separation of concerns with distinct frontend, backend, and AI service layers.
2. **Scalability**: The microservices architecture allows independent scaling of components.
3. **User-Centric Design**: The UI prioritizes clarity and ease of use, with visual indicators for transparency scores.
4. **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation and error handling ensure data consistency.
5. **Performance**: Optimized database queries and efficient state management ensure responsive performance.

The transparency scoring logic is designed to be fair and comprehensive, considering multiple factors like ingredient disclosure, manufacturing processes, and sustainability practices. The system is built to be extensible, allowing for additional metrics and scoring dimensions as the platform evolves.
